# Google Homepage Clone

Welcome to my very first project! This repository contains a simple and visually appealing recreation of the Google homepage, built entirely with HTML and CSS.

## 📝 About This Project

This project was created on **April 8, 2025** as a personal learning exercise. The goal was to challenge myself to replicate the look and feel of the original Google homepage, focusing on:

- Structuring HTML elements to match Google's clean layout
- Styling with CSS to achieve a polished, modern look
- Gaining hands-on experience with web development fundamentals

## 💡 Features

- Responsive design (adapts to different screen sizes)
- Accurate layout of the search box, buttons, and footer
- Clean, simple, and minimalist styles inspired by Google

## 🚀 Getting Started

To view the homepage locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FreddyJ01/GoogleHomepage.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd GoogleHomepage
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**

That's it! No additional setup is required.
